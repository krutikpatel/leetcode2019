==> Top-Down
-top-down ineherently means recursive if u think.
-then we can add memoisation to it to make it DP
-memo 2D/1D array will be 2or1 params that we pass to recursive funtion

==>Bottom-up
-since we build up solution its bottom-up and iterative
-start with sol(0) => this is something we know as base case, and use that to build up to sol(n)

==>Memo Array size 
-always [n][size/count/profit whatever param is + 1]
n is given array's length

==>time complexity for recursive calls:
if we make 2 calls is 2^n
because calling tree will have 2^n nodes
