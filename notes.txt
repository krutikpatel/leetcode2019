		2		3
	4		5
Depth First Traversals: 
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3

(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
	
to remember:
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/e_lesson_convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree.java
		-in each recursive call, node.val = middle of arrary. pass left and right bounds to rec call 
		
	-https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/
		-follow BST property from root to bottom 
		-so, iterative is good.
		-at each node record and update min diff. whether we go left or right, we dont know what is going to be closest.
		-record min diff from target also record that node because we need node.
			-acrtually just recodr node, and keep comparing the diff 
		
	-lesson_binary-tree-postorder-traversal.java	-> there are mutiple ways to iterate using stack. see which one suites me.
	
	-https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/ 
		-top-down -check each node is balanced with helper method of height. O(n^2)
		-botttom up O(N) - needs node to store info - whether its balanced or not. build up on that.
			-even without storing info - bottom up is O(n)
			-visit eaach node once - Post order - call both children first.
			-this O(n) method to look for heigh difference called once only. store result in class var OR propagate in ret val.
		-THERE IS SUBTLE DIFFERENE BETWEEN THESE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND YET
		-same technique is used here for O(n):
			https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/e_diameter-of-binary-tree.java
	
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/e_lesson_subtree-of-another-tree.java
		-checking at each node is O(n^2)
		-converting tree to string - but order matters
		IMP - order matters. inorder will not work.
		ONLY preorder will work. its node by node comarision from top.
		ALSO: we need to count null leafs in string too, to avoid wrong comparisions, which gives false true.
        -to avoid returning true for example 2 above
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_binary-search-tree-iterator.java
		-next returns min elem - thus its in order retrival
		-we can use stack to store in-order sequence
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_count-univalue-subtrees.java
		-check for curr node as univalue 
			if(n.right !=null && n.right.val != n.val)
                return false;
            if(n.left !=null && n.left.val != n.val)
                return false;
		-no need to overcomlicate - one helper method traversal over whole tree is enough. no need to pass down n.val
 		-post order traversal/DFS - call l & r, then decide if parent is univalue.
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_find-duplicate-subtrees.java
		-convert tree in string (INCLUDING NULL NODES) 
		-only certain order will work - POST order 
		-ONLY add dplicate trees to result once
			-For people who are curious about why in-order doesn't work, here's a simple example:
			TreeA:
			0
			/
			0

			TreeB:
			0
			\
			0

			They both have same in-order serialization "#0#0#" if we just use "#" to represent null.

	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list.java 
		-post order traversal  - no return val needed for linking
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_boundary-of-binary-tree.java
		-level order cant help here. 1 node in queue does not tell whether its on left edge or right edge
		//-store 1st in left and last in right lists.
		-ret.add(root);
		now for left edge: call -> getedge(root.left)
		for rightEdge: getedge(root.right)
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_inorder-successor-in-bst.java
		-successor will be right of x -> once u go right it can be n or n.left
		-keep going left and right as per BST, whenever go left (record n as return value first)
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_insufficient-nodes-in-root-to-leaf-paths.java
		-good one with regards to passing vals and returning node and making links
		Also, IMP to note that we do : DFS in POST order traversal way. ie, we go to leaf first, we call left and right first,
		then we can decide whether a parent is sufficient or not
		IMP:
		1.although its like postorder, we process sum before calling children, because sum has to be passed down.
		2.we check if its leaf node, and check sum condition here. BEcause we need to return from here.
			-if we go to null node, it will always return null, and upper level will think that its insufficient.
			
		-pass down sum sofar
		-if sum < target at leaf, return null 
		-if n.l and n.r both becomes null, return null. -delete this node.
		
		=>There are two codnitions when we return null, or remove nodes:
			1. if sum < target at leaf, return null 
			2. both left and right are null, so they point to no good path.
			
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst.java
		-in-order tarversal and counter k (incement/decrement happens in-order, on current node. so counting does not start til lwe reach left most) - we dont have to worry about reaching left most elem and then start counting exclusively. that is part of "in order" processing.
		-that needs helper method (and class var for result ). cant be done in-place otherwise.
		-recursive - if we dont want class var - pass arr [counter,retVal]
		-iterative using stack, recursive usual. 
		
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree.java
		-first thought comes is helper method to find 2 elems under given node 
		-BUT we dodnt need that extra FIND method O(n^2)
		-//if root is p or q, that is LCA
        if( root == p || root == q || root == null)
            return root;
			
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_lesson_most-frequent-subtree-sum.java
		-dont need to calculate sum at each node separately
		-traverse tree once and record sums in map. map<sum,count>
		-sum = left+right+curr
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/m_serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree.java
		Ser:
		pre-roder, # for null and ',' as delimiter
		Logic Note:
			-Serialization: we used recursion in pre-order manner
			-Deserialization:
				-we have data in certain order. to reuild tree out of it, follow same order 
				a-data was built with recursion, so use recusrion
				b-order was pre-order - so use pre-order
				c-how to fetch elems in deserRecFunction that order?
					-use Q to fetch elems in that order. (can be done using array and index, but prone to error)
					
		Deser:
		Queue + preorder resursion
		Use Queue<> for deser, put all nodes in Q and just recreate tree in Pre-order fashion
		-Use Queue as FIFO, because thats the order in which we want to remove elems from list
		-IMP thing is deser is done in recursive fashion, just like pre-order, and elem taken from Queue every time in FIFO order

		-serialie - tree to array/string 
			-DFS pre-order traversal suits prob - bcoz that will make deser job easy. need to put null indicator in string 
		-desrialize - split string with delimiter ',' to get array 
			-use Queue , insert array in Queue - to get FIFO order
			-remove them one by one and just link them recursively (pre-order recursion)
	-https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/binary_tree/h_binary-tree-maximum-path-sum.java
		-DFS/Post order traversal helps with O(n) path sum cal
		-imp to think which all paths are valid, and can possibly max . nodes can have -ve values 
		-maintain class level max 
		-helper: return currPathMaxSum - so that upper level can be max 
						-that is currPathMaxSum = n.val + Math.max(l,r);
				-for l and r, important to take 0 if return val is negative, so that currPath does not become less due to -ve children.
	
	https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii
	-sounds simple. but can be little tricky to write CLEAN solution 
	-note: we dont need to precompute both paths 
		-root is not provided 
		
		-LCA is simple :
			-if we know one path(node to root). put all nodes in set 
			-go over other path (node to root) , and when you find/stop at common point  

	IMP for LCA problems:
		-forming both paths is not good idea.
		-dont do that 

	https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-ii
		p or q can be null. not guaranteed to be in tree !
		-dont worry about figuring out path.
		-if p or q is not in tree, LCA is null. so we need to know if they are there.
		-single helper method can check for both. maintain global count or boolean for both
		-Also, if both are present, while traversing, we can also find LCA answer like : https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ 
			-VIMP the getLca helper method:
			-first left and right calls  - Becasue we want exhaustive search so that we find both p and q , rather than just lca of them.
			-rest lca method is same as : https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ 
			

	https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
		IMP:
		-recursive very easy, yet forget and find it complicated.
		-1stof all, recursive one pass is possible, so remember that.

	[hard remaining]
TODO:
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/ - add this to github
	-we maintain min PQ, and keep adding. when size > k , we remove. so top gets removed, which is min. so in the end, we have top/max k elems in PQ! 
	
to remember:
	https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/
		-give that array is sorted. AND can contain -ve nums 
		max square of -ve num will be greater at 0 index and decreases
		-create extra ret arr
		-fill from end 
		-only problem is -ve elems 
		-keep 2 ptrs : l and r 
			-regardless of there is -ve or not, 
			ret[i] = max of Sq(l) and Sq(r) 
		
	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/array/m_daily-temperatures.java	
		-> stack the indices rather than temp vals, because we need index diff. -> start from end -> monotonic stack.
		-pop first till stack top is less than curr 
		-then push curr anyways 
		imp - we store index in stack
		
	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/array/m_4sum.java
		-For each elem [i], solve k-1 problem recursively, at k=2, solve 2sum problem
			-2sum loop/sweep shud not end as soon as we find pair, because we need to find ALL pairs to continue till (l<r)
		
		-Time complexity is O(N^(K-1)).
		-generalize as :
		private List<List<Integer>> kSum(int[] nums, int target, int k, int leftBegin)
		-run loop till it becomes 2 sum prob OR k=2
			-that k loop looks like :
			for (int i = left; i < len - (k - 1); i++) {
                //use current number to reduce ksum into k-1sum
				//arr[i] will be part of sol list
                List<List<Integer>> curr = kSum(nums, target - nums[i], k-1, i+1);
				=> then add arr[i] to each lists returned
				
		-duplicate check has to be done in 2 sum as well as other loop too

	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/array/m_lesson_3sum-smaller.java
		-tricky - there is more than just counting at each 2 sum sweep.
		-at any given 2sum sweep : if(localsum<target)
			-we need to count all combinations keeping "low or l constant". 
			x,l,r
			x,l,r-1 
			x,l,r-2 etc
		-that will not be covered in next iteration. bcoz if localsum<target, we will move to l++
			
	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/array/m_lesson_find-all-duplicates-in-an-array.java
		-nums are 1 to n -> convert that to index/bucket as arr[i]-1
		-every time we see num, we do x * -1
		-so if num seen only once, it will be -ve 
		-second loop can catch this 
		-use Math.abs while calculting index, because num can be -ve as done by us only 
		
	cherry pick algo:
	https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/ - remember the basic trick, write ptr, read ptr. no need to run fast pointer all at once
		-write/good ptr. ptr to track index to unique elems. (slow, write location) => this of this ptr as if we had new empty array where we store desired elems for return. ptr in that array where we can write new elem.
		-iterator ptr (fast, read ptr)
		=>similar qns: (in place array operations - single iteration solutions)
			https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/
			https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/

	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/array/m_lesson_subarray-sum-equals-k.java
		-Sliding window cannot be used, because array contains negative number
		-Its "prefix sum" problem.
		-Solution 1. Brute force. We just need two loops (i, j) and test if SUM[i, j] = k. Time complexity O(n^2), Space complexity O(1). 
		-Solution 2. From solution 1, we know the key to solve this problem is SUM[i, j]. 
			-we need faster way to find SUM[i, j]
			-So if we know SUM[0, i] and SUM[0, j], then we can easily get SUM[i, j]
				SUM[i, j] = SUM[0, i] - SUM[0, j]
			
		-since we are asked to count HOW many times we see the sum, we need to store the Map<sumseen_sofar, count>
		-keep recording sum so far in map.
			-if we have seen  ( SUM[0, i] - target ) -> add this to answer.
			
	https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/
		-A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea. track 0 converted elems/visited elems. so that we dont consider them original 0s.
		-improvement: only track col and row nums which needs to be zeroed. PAss1: record these rows and cols. PAss2: zero down those rows and cols. 2*O(mn)
		- work on memory efficient soln
			-> use this soln: https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/discuss/26008/My-AC-java-O(1)-solution-(easy-to-read)
			-They are using the first row and column as a memory to keep track of all the 0's in the entire matrix.
			-only problem with that is : if 0th row or col is 0. - >becaues if so : if 0throw is 0, we need to make 0th col zero as well. as same for cols 
			-so use 2 more flags to indicate if fr or fc is zero.

4. 	BFS and queue:

There are 2 aspects to BFS.
-some problems, first figure out which all nodes need bfs and add them in queue.
-some problems, just start with one node in queue as starting point.

-level order traversal.
-iterate thru all neighbors?

Continue from: https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/

to remember:
	https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix
		-natural instinct : start from 1's go find till 0 reached.
			-that BFS is only good if we were to find shortest distance for that 1 cell. To find it for ALL cells, we will need separate BFS from each cell.
		-So, rahter, start from eacch 0 cells as BFS in parallel. 
			-basically statrt from desired destination ("0" cells ) when we need shortest distance (for all ("1")cells ) in matrix.

		1. add all 0 to Q 
		2. we need to take action when se we see 1 (we make them: currCell+1). make all 1's as other constant: MAX (or keep another matrix of unvisited 1's). -we only operate on cell ONCE. so mark them as untouched 
		3. BFS 
			if cell == MAX, convert and MAX to currCell+1, as distance marker for 0 to reach it.
		4.	-Add that neighbor to Q (eg vals: 1,2,3 these are distances)
		5. IMP - in the while(!q.isEmpty()) loop 
				-we just take one cell, and visit all its neighbors. 
				-we dont loop over all q elems in this iteration. actually we never do that ! we always take 1 elem and visit all its neighbors.
				
	https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/solution/ - DFS 
	https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/solution/
		-DFS is more natural here. But BFS has advantage of less heap space.
		-need to keep track of visited nodes 
		-for(4 directions) {
			newpos = roll()
			if(dfs(newPos))
				return true;
		}
		
		BFS
		-add start pt in Q
		-poll Q 
		-add to visited 
		-check if its dest
		for(4 dirs) {
			newpos = roll(dir);
			if(not visited newPos)
				Q.add(newpos)
				
		}
		
	https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
	-first need to cound good oranges, because its possible that whole sweep cannot reach all good oranges, so we need to return -1 in that case.

		-we only add nodes to Q once, 
		1. initially
		2. when we convert them to rotten in loop 
	
	maze-ii 
		-how do we keep track of distance travelled for each direction while doing BFS 
			-create a new matrix for that. dist[i][j] = i,j distance from start point.
		-when we roll, we need to return final point where roll stops
			-we also need to return dist travelled. use int[3]
		-create move/roll method, and also create isValid method.

	https://github.com/krutikpatel/leetcode2019/blob/master/hashmap/m_insert-delete-getrandom-o1.java
to remember:
	-log rate limiter - study various approaches IMP
		-we need LAST 10 sec window, 10 slots. queue, array, circular buffer whatever u think of.
		-Also, we need Set for each slot, so that we know whether incoming log was printed in any of last 10 secs
		a. figure out slot - based on given timestamp. clear old slot if not same. clear old set as well in that case
		b. check if msg was printed in last 10 secs. go thru each slot (see if slot time < 10 secs) and see if present in any of the sets.

IMP note:
===================
-template2 - given that arr is ascendin sorted, and we do l = m+1 when x<target
IMP - below obs are in terms of "index", l is index. Not the elem at index.

	Obs1 . what index does template-2 settle at? what is end val of l - when elem not found?
		->it settles on left/smaller (closest) side of target!
			-so if target was greater than the max num of arr, it WILL settle on last index of arr. !
		->that means normal template 2 serves as "CEILING" function. 
	
	Obs2
		-template2 will always return a "VALID" index. (0 to len-1)
	
	Obs3
		-template1 may return a "INVALID" index. (0 to "len") - when num is bigger than upper bound
	
	Obs4
		-template 1 also settles on the num (closest Bigger) than target, if target not in arr.
		-so it serves as "CEILING" function (except last elem, for which check is needed)
	
	Obs4 
		-it template 1 and 2 both does celing, AND we return if we find num itself,
		-floor index = l-1; //we shud set l =1 in beginning though 
--------	
IMP:
	-"we dont have to memorize limits."
	-limit/bounds are defined by us/algo itself.
	l=0,r=len-1 
	while(l<r)
		-->here l cannot go below 0
		-->l cannot go above r, it can be r when loop exits . r = len-1, thus valid index 
--------
		
	-sometimes, when we want to derive a fitting index (may be elem?), we need to be careful of 'r'
	-normally r = arr.len-1 
	but if we want to settle to correct index - we may want to set r = arr.len
		Example:
		https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/
			-if target is out of array 
			-we have to imagine array is len+1. and return index accordingly
			-template1 works very good here. BUT if we want to use template2, we need to set r = arr.len
			
	-Think another problem: 
		1. return index of elem smaller than target 
		2. return index of elem bigger than target 
		3. floor function 
	
	-Trick on template2 
		-to get floor functionality out of template 2:
			set l = 1 and r = len
			-because we know it will settle down on celingin elem 

Floor-function: TODO - I think it is same as search insert position problem! but here, if elem = target, we cant return that, we want floor of the target.
	-there are only 3 possibilities
		-target below 0	-> ret: -1
		-target above arr.len-1 -> ret: len-1
		-target index inside arr -> left of target 
		
	-IMP- its easier to get corner cases right away before doing loop.
        // If last element is smaller than x
        if (x >= arr[r])
            return r;
		if(x <arr[0])
			return -1;
		
		-now run template1 or 2 , either is ok, becaues we always narrow down towards smaller elem :
		if (array[mid] >target) {
			r=m-1 or m
		}
		
Celining:
	-template 2

		-Imagine a/b = k as a link between node a and b, the weight from a to b is k, the reverse link is 1/k. Query is to find a path between two nodes.
		-for each node, we need neighbors and weight of that edge. Best way to do that is Map<neightboer,weigth> for each node
		-adj list with weights : Map<String, Map<String, Double>> adj
		-need to track visited nodes in DFS to catch loop. 
		-return -1 for no sol and loops.
		IMP break conds:
			-if from is not in adj or to is not in adj map -> fail return -1
			-if visited in adj, we r in loop -> return -1 
			-no backtracking involved (in visited set, we just go from, from -> to in 1 call, we do not begin with other start point)

			-after return, add 1st word in front of return list to form answer string 
		
		(see in comment section in above link: its still easy to go char by char, we dont have to pass charIndex in recursive call.)

		Algo:

			-char by char, form work and lookup in dict.

Note:
-MIMP: think recursive prob as solving subproblem. eg: 
	-Permutation: abc -> a + permutations of (bc)
	-subset: abc -> a + subsets of (bc)
	-so we solve subproblem first, as a result output will be in that order.
	-combinaitions of 1,2,3,4 -> take 1 (add 1 to sofar) and solve problem recursively from 2
	
-permutations output order for swap based recursive algo
	Input: nums = [1,2,3]
	Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
	
-duplicates: 
	-the first call at any level is i=beginIndex: so we need to allow i=beginIndex but avoid duplicates.
		so: if(i!=beginIndex && twoNumsAreStillsame)
	-we normally sort entries so that duplicates are together. we might get away without sorting for permutation because of swap, but for subsets we need to.

-subsets output order will be:
	Input: nums = [1,2,2]
	Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
	if(soFar.size() > 0){
		ret.add(new ArrayList(soFar));//we make new cipy of list to add in result because this copy will keep modifying.

	-combintion of DFS and backtracking - super problem.
	-backtracking is during each DFS for visited nodes.
	-NOTE: visited boolean[][] does not have to be created fresh for every DFS starting point x,y. since we are backtracking and clearing flags, same map can be reused as is dugin next x,y DFS check.


13. DP
Note:
Notice how we construct the solution from using the previous solutions (previous values in array). 
This is in essence Dynamic Programming where you remember the previous computed values and make calculations faster.

		-soln(i) = derived from solj( 0 to i) --> because we already know solution of probs till "i", and we began i from 0.

			-We need a general way to figure out when a part of the array is worth keeping.
			-any subarray whose sum is positive is worth keeping.
		-Ans: we don't actually need to build the subarray, we can just keep an integer variable current_subarray and add the values of each element there. When it becomes negative, we reset it to 0 (an empty array).
			-track max 
			-keep adding till sum is +ve

    -A node 'num' is directly connected to its neighbours 'num-1' and 'num+1' if present in the array.
    -So basically we first prepare an adjacency list 'map' while iterating through all the array elements.
        //partial adj list, one node can help u get +-1 , and that node will lead u to its +-1
    -Now we do a BFS for each sub-graph and find out its size. If it's greater than 'max', we update max.
