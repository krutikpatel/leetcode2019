Think of time complexities

Good page for mathematical formula for permutations and combinations

Permutation: order matters
Combination: order does not matter

1. Permutation : n!
2. Picking m out of n (Permutations) : n!/(n âˆ’ r)!
3. Picking m out of n (combinations) : n!/r!(n âˆ’ r)!


Note:
For any int array, to avoid duplicates:
a. Sort array
b. if i>0 && A[i] == A[i-1] , skip
